				description: '<p>Academic career or Industry job? East coast or West bay? These are the common dichotomy that many of us have faced at some point of our career trajectories. But there is actually a third career path for those with creativity, courage, and capability: academic entrepreneurship in which scientist can still possess the academic freedom and the opportunity to bring their discoveries to market. The rising Lonestar is also fostering a vibrant biocluster to attract talents and other resources, which might become the “Third Coast” of the biotech industry. With more options, how could we grab the opportunities to thrive in the era of biotech?</p><p>To unleash the potential of your career development, TTBA 2017 symposium will bring you <strong>2 keynote speeches given by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung, the Vice President of MD-Anderson</strong>, <strong>and Mr. Gene Lay, the Founder and CEO of BioLegend</strong>, to share their visions of how innovations reshape the world. TTBA will also host <strong>5 panel discussions</strong> covering (1) academic entrepreneurship, (2) startups in Texas, (3) jobs beyond the bench, (4) an in-depth discussion of biotech ecosystem in the States, and (5) the opportunity in Taiwan. We truly believe that the 2-day symposium will expand the horizon of your career and root your connection into the fields where your calling is.</p><p>TTBA 2017 Symposium is our third symposium since 2015. TTBA is proud of hosting the high-quality symposium and creating an engaging network environment filled with the  Taiwanese hospitality. Please join us now. We welcome all graduate students, postdocs, and professionals in bio-related fields.</p>'
