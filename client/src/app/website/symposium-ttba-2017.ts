				description: '<p>Academic career or Industry job? East coast or West bay? These are the common dichotomy that many of us have faced at some point of our career trajectories. But there is actually a third career path for those with creativity, courage, and capability: academic entrepreneurship in which scientist can still possess the academic freedom and the opportunity to bring their discoveries to market. The rising Lonestar is also fostering a vibrant biocluster to attract talents and other resources, which might become the “Third Coast” of the biotech industry. With more options, how could we grab the opportunities to thrive in the era of biotech?</p><p>To unleash the potential of your career development, TTBA 2017 symposium will bring you <strong>2 keynote speeches given by Dr. Mien-Chie Hung, the Vice President of MD-Anderson</strong>, <strong>and Mr. Gene Lay, the Founder and CEO of BioLegend</strong>, to share their visions of how innovations reshape the world. TTBA will also host <strong>5 panel discussions</strong> covering (1) academic entrepreneurship, (2) startups in Texas, (3) jobs beyond the bench, (4) an in-depth comparison of company cultures at east and west coasts, and (5) the opportunity in Taiwan. We truly believe that the 2-day symposium will expand the horizon of your career and root your connection into the fields where your calling is.</p><p>TTBA 2017 Symposium is our third symposium since 2015. TTBA is proud of hosting the high-quality symposium and creating an engaging network environment filled with the  Taiwanese hospitality. Please join us now. We welcome all graduate students, postdocs, and professionals in bio-related fields.</p>'

Dr. Hung is internationally recognized for his studies of signal transduction pathways regulated by tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, such as EGFR and HER-2/neu, as well as molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Up to date, Dr. Hung has published more than 475 peer-reviewed articles and his lifetime h-index is 107. Dr. Hung has served in many study sections of the NIH and various funding agencies in many other countries to select awardees. He is one of members of Selection Committee for Tang Prize in Biopharmaceutical Science category and 2016 Pezcoller Foundation-AACR Award. Dr. Hung also serves as an editorial member for many journals in cancer research to evaluate quality of submission. Notable, he is one of the founding Editorial Members for Cancer Cell and Editor-in-chief for American Journal for Cancer Research. Dr. Hung was inducted as an Academician of the Academia Sinica in Taiwan in 2002. In addition, Dr. Hung was selected as a Fellow in Biological Sciences section, American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2010. Dr. Hung is a basic scientist with a keen translational vision and especially his recent research effort has significantly contributed to understanding the biology of cancer and to developing combinational cancer therapies to overcome resistance. His laboratory has a long term commitment to 1) discovery of novel functionality of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family which may provide useful insight to understand cancer formation and development; 2) identification of crosstalks of signal pathways/networks in cancer cells and tumor microenvironment which could potentially predict resistance to target therapy; and 3) development of marker-guided targeted therapy including immune checkpoint therapy which will effectively treat cancer patients.',

His research goal aims to explore key components, including proteins, trace elements and bioactive metabolites and their modes of action in the modulation of various physiologic and pathologic roles. Firstly, we are interested in understanding the molecular mechanism of cancer progression, especially to elucidate how cancer cells and tumor microenvironment participate in cell migrate, the formation of pre-metastatic niches and contributing to metastatic organotropism. Several biomolecules, including integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases, and cytokines as well as extracellular vesicles exosomes, are main targets in our studies. Additionally, Shen lab is also seeking useful natural products and de novo protein components in human cells including critical secondary metabolites from traditional Chinese medicinal fungi, Cordyceps spp, Antrodia cinnamomea, and metallothioneins, to apply on anti-cancer, anti-aging or other complication therapeutics.',
