# FccTwitchtv

Build a app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/).

## User Stories

1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
3. If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

## Hints

1. [An example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API](http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541)
2. [The relevant documentation about this API call](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user)
3. Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: ["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]
4.  Use `https://wind-bow.gomix.me/twitch-api` instead of twitch's API base URL

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
